## üõí&nbsp;&nbsp;What is litecart?

Litecart is an open source shopping-cart in 1 file of embedded database (SQLite), convenient dashboard UI and simple site.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Current major version is zero (`v0.x.x`) to accommodate rapid development and fast iteration while getting early feedback from users. Please keep in mind that litecart is still under active development and therefore full backward compatibility is not guaranteed before reaching v1.0.0.

#### <img width="20" src="/.github/media/platforms/docker.svg">&nbsp;Run using Docker
Docker enables the management and operation of a `litecart` instance without requiring the installation of any command-line tools. The `litecart` Docker container includes all necessary command-line tools  or even for server execution.

For [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shurco/litecart):
```bash
docker run \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \
  -v ./site:/site \
  --rm shurco/litecart:latest init

docker run \
  --name litecart \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p '8080:8080' \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \
  -v ./site:/site \
  shurco/litecart:latest
```
or if use [Github Packages Hub](https://github.com/shurco/litecart/pkgs/container/litecart):

```bash
docker run \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \

## ‚¨áÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Updating
> ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any update, be sure to make a backup of the *./lc_base* folder and the *./site* folder.

#### Update on macOS / Linux / Windows
The easiest way to update `litecart` to the latest version is to execute the command:

```bash
./litecart update
```

If there were changes in the database structure during the update, it is necessary to perform migration. To do this, you need to run the command from the `litecart` folder:
```bash
./litecart migrate
```


#### <img width="20" src="/.github/media/platforms/docker.svg">&nbsp; Update using Docker
Our mantra is to make updating a seamless experience. Simply download the new image and launch the container as you normally would. For example, if use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shurco/litecart):

```bash
docker stop litecart
docker pull shurco/litecart:latest # download new image
docker rename litecart litecart-backup # do image backup
docker run \
  --name litecart \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p '8080:8080' \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \
  -v ./site:/site \
  shurco/litecart:latest
```

If there were changes in the database structure during the update, it is necessary to perform migration. To do this, you need to run the command from the `litecart` folder:
```bash
docker run \
-v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
-v ./site:/site \
--rm shurco/litecart migrate
```

## üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting started
Getting started with `litecart` is as easy as starting up the `litecart` server

Default run for Linux/macOS:
```bash
./litecart serve
```

For Windows:
```
litecart.exe serve
```

When launched for the first time, necessary folders will be created in the directory with the executable file. The default links for access are:  
- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - website  
- [http://localhost:8080/_/](http://localhost:8080/_/) - control panel  

If you need to run on a different port, use the flag `--http`:
```
./litecart serve --http 0.0.0.0:8088
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp; Ports <= 1024 are privileged ports. You can't use them unless you're root or have the explicit permission to use them. See this answer for an explanation or wikipedia or something you trust more. Use:
**sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path_to/litecart**
> 

## üìö&nbsp;&nbsp;Commands
