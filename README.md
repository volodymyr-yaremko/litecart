Docker enables the management and operation of a `litecart` instance without requiring the installation of any command-line tools. The `litecart` Docker container includes all necessary command-line tools  or even for server execution.

For [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shurco/litecart):
```bash
docker run \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \
  -v ./site:/site \
  --rm shurco/litecart:latest init

docker run \
  --name litecart \

## ⬇️&nbsp;&nbsp;Updating
> [!WARNING]
> Before any update, be sure to make a backup of the *./lc_base* folder and the *./site* folder.

#### Update on macOS / Linux / Windows
The easiest way to update `litecart` to the latest version is to execute the command:

```bash
./litecart update
```

If there were changes in the database structure during the update, it is necessary to perform migration. To do this, you need to run the command from the `litecart` folder:
```bash
./litecart migrate
```


#### <img width="20" src="/.github/media/platforms/docker.svg">&nbsp; Update using Docker
Our mantra is to make updating a seamless experience. Simply download the new image and launch the container as you normally would. For example, if use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shurco/litecart):

```bash
docker stop litecart
docker pull shurco/litecart:latest # download new image
docker rename litecart litecart-backup # do image backup
docker run \
  --name litecart \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p '8080:8080' \
  -v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
  -v ./lc_digitals:/lc_digitals \
  -v ./lc_uploads:/lc_uploads \
  -v ./site:/site \
  shurco/litecart:latest
```

If there were changes in the database structure during the update, it is necessary to perform migration. To do this, you need to run the command from the `litecart` folder:
```bash
docker run \
-v ./lc_base:/lc_base \
-v ./site:/site \
--rm shurco/litecart migrate
```

## 🚀&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting started
Getting started with `litecart` is as easy as starting up the `litecart` server

Default run for Linux/macOS:
```bash
./litecart serve
```

For Windows:
```
litecart.exe serve
```

When launched for the first time, necessary folders will be created in the directory with the executable file. The default links for access are:  
- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - website  
- [http://localhost:8080/_/](http://localhost:8080/_/) - control panel  

If you need to run on a different port, use the flag `--http`:
```
./litecart serve --http 0.0.0.0:8088
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ports <= 1024 are privileged ports. You can't use them unless you're root or have the explicit permission to use them. See this answer for an explanation or wikipedia or something you trust more. Use:
> **sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path_to/litecart**

## 🧩&nbsp;&nbsp;For developers
The backend is developed in Go language. The frontend (admin site and base site) operates on the Vue3 and TailwindCSS.  

There are a number of scripts (in the ./scripts folder) that simplify development:  
`./scripts/golang` - Installs or updates a previously installed version of go (if needed).  
`./scripts/migration` - Helps to work with migrations. For instance, the `./scripts/migration dev up` command will apply new migrations from folder ./migrations, then implement the migrations from folder ./fixtures.  
`./scripts/sqlite` - Optimizes the existing database.  
`./scripts/tools` - Sets up the necessary environment for development (if needed).  
`./scripts/webscripts` - For the basic site, updates vue3 to the latest version.  

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend running the `./scripts/migration dev up` command. It will add test data to the database, which makes it easier to work with. For example, it will create products, transfer test images and create a test user for access to the admin panel:  
> login - user@mail.com  
> password - Pass123

#### Admin panel (frontend)
To develop the web interface of the admin panel, you need to start the litepay server (for example, execute the command from the project root `go run ./cmd/main.go serve`).
The entire code is located in the folder ./web/admin.  
All the code is located in the folder ./web/admin. The command `cd ./web/admin && yarn run dev` will start the development server for the admin panel web interface. By default, it will be available at http://localhost:5173/_/.

#### Base site (frontend)
To develop the web interface of the admin panel, you need to start the litepay server (for example, execute the command from the project root `go run ./cmd/main.go serve`).  
Run `./scripts/webscripts` to download and install the necessary JavaScript libraries into the folder ./web/site/public/assets/js/.
To update the styles, it is necessary to execute the command `cd ./web/site && yarn run build`.  
If you actively change styles, you can run the command `cd ./web/site && yarn run dev`. It will monitor changes in files and automatically update the style file.

## 🗺️&nbsp;&nbsp;ToDo
`litecart` has a [roadmap](https://github.com/users/shurco/projects/2) and I try to work on issues in specific order and such PRs often come in out of nowhere and skew all initial planning with tedious back-and-forth communication.
